To run: "./bin/caffeine"
To compile translations: "./update_translations"

If you want to test out a translation without changing the language for the
whole session: "LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8 ./bin/caffeine" (Replace ru_RU.UTF-8
with whatever language you want to use. You will need to a language pack
for the specific language) Be aware that some stock items
will not be translated unless you log in with a given language.
