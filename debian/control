Description: Prevent the desktop becoming idle in full-screen mode
 Caffeine stops the desktop becoming idle when an application
 is running full-screen. A desktop indicator ‘caffeine-indicator’
 supplies a manual toggle, and the command ‘caffeinate’ can be used
 to prevent idleness for the duration of any command.
