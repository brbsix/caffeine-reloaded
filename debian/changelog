caffeine (2.6) saucy; urgency=low

  * Auto-activate the screensaver when a full-screen window is present.
  * Remove the ability to watch processes; applications should inhibit
    idleness themselves, and many now do.
  * Remove -a and -d command-line arguments: single-instance
    nature of Caffeine means it shouldn't be used from the command
    line. xdg-screensaver should be used instead.
  * Bump to standards 3.9.5 (no change).
